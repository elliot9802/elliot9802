# Hello there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

👨‍💻 I'm a .NET Developer based in Sweden, currently wrapping up my Yrkeshögskola course. I have a passion for learning and prefer to explore new technologies in English, which helps me stay connected with global tech trends.

🌊 As part of my education, I'm doing an internship at a company that specializes in booking and grant application systems, primarily used by municipalities for managing facilities like swimming pools and museums.

## What I'm Working On

- 📚 Developing my skills in .NET and related technologies.
- 💼 Internship project: Focusing on improving PDF generation processes for ticketing systems. I've worked extensively with Syncfusion and have recently built an API from scratch for dynamic PDF creation.
- 🚀 Exploring innovative solutions to enhance user experience in booking and grant applications.

## My Internship Journey

- 🔍 Initially tasked with identifying the best library for PDF generation, I concluded Syncfusion was a top choice.
- 🛠️ Not stopping there, I initiated a project to create PDFs from scratch, leading to a more efficient and faster solution.
- ✨ I pride myself on taking initiatives and pushing boundaries to deliver solutions that exceed expectations.
